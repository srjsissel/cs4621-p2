## Description

### Project 1
We want to build a procedurally generated world using low-poly models. It will be in a forest-theme with generated terrains and plants (trees, grasses, mushrooms). Our world will have two main features. The first one is water generation (ponds, streams, rivers) with reflective surfaces. The second one is a slider to control the healthiness of the environment (from desert to rainforest). The player can explore the world using a first person point of view with a flying control. Optionally, we may implement a walking control and cave generation.

### Project 2
We want to extend the features of our procedurally generated world. Our world will have a more complex ecosystem which may include small creatures and a weather system like rain and clouds. We will also improve the current performance of the world generation by adding chunk loading mechanisms. Since we have no player interactions with the environment in the Project1, we plan to add more interactions for the player to explore the world, like planting trees, diving into the water, or playing with the small creatures. If time permits, we plan to extend our system by adding third-person views, animations, and more VR controls.
