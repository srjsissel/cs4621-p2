## Framework:

Unity 2021.3.9f1

## Description:

We want to build a procedurally generated world using low-poly models. It will be in a forest-theme with generated terrains and plants (trees, grasses, mushrooms). Our world will have two main features. The first one is water generation (ponds, streams, rivers) with reflective surfaces. The second one is a slider to control the healthiness of the environment (from desert to rainforest). The player can explore the world using a first person point of view with a flying control. Optionally, we may implement a walking control and cave generation.
